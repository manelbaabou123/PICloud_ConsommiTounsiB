Consommi Tounsi is a product management platform dedicated for selling 100% Tunisian products. The goal is to manage our own online web-shop which exclusively sells Tunisian products, while ensuring a good user experience by facilitating purchases of all Tunisian products, as well as, ensuring a worldwide shipping with the best after-sales customer service. Besides selling, Consommi Tounsi offers a charitable space for fundraising as well as organizing charitable events. Each shop owner will have access to a web based application form anywhere and using any device. They will not have to carry out the application installation, maintenance or troubleshooting in case of failure since it will be hosted and managed by our company. Consommi Tounsi will suit the needs of both small and large shops as it includes auto-scaling capabilities. The proposed solution should be able to provide to each shop owner his own instance of the application. For that reason, the infrastructure should provide solutions to make the deployment of the application easy, rapid, and possible over any type of hardware or operating system.
